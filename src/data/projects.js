            "Redesigned the mobile flight booking experience to make selection and comparison faster, clearer, and less overwhelming.\n\n" +
            "Focused on information hierarchy, transfer clarity, and fare transparency across the Flight and Passenger Details pages.\n\n" +

        roles: ["UX Designer", "Researcher"],
        tools: ["Figma", "Miro"],
        timeline: "8 weeks",
        problem: "Mobile airline booking is dense and error-prone: users struggle to spot transfers, compare fares, and understand total journey details. Most forms front-load too many fields and bury key context (duration, stops, baggage rules), causing hesitation and drop-offs.\n The goal was to create a booking flow users can complete confidently in under two minutes, with clear visual guidance and minimal cognitive load.",
        approach:
            "Research: 2 observation sessions (users booking in two different apps) + 1 think-aloud interview; notes synthesized into an affinity diagram and a customer journey map to locate friction points.\n\n" +
            "Ideation: Prioritized clarity for connections and fares; explored timeline/grouped flight cards, progressive disclosure of fare details, and icon-based inclusions (baggage, meals, flexibility).\n\n" +
            "Design: Flight Selection with connected blocks showing total time, layovers, and price at a glance; persistent Filter/Sort (Direct, Cheapest/Fastest); three uniform fare tiers (Basic/Regular/Extra) with clear iconography; streamlined Booking Form with smart airport suggestions, simple date picker, and minimal fields per screen.\n\n" +
            "Validation (planned): heuristic review completed; future usability tests to measure task time, fare comprehension, and accessibility on small screens.",
        outcome: "Delivered a streamlined, mobile-first booking experience where users can quickly scan routes, understand transfers, and compare fares without reading dense text. Visual grouping, progressive disclosure, and consistent iconography reduced cognitive load and improved decision speed.\n While formal testing was not conducted, the prototype establishes a strong foundation for validation; next steps include measuring task completion time, error rates, and confidence during fare selection.",
